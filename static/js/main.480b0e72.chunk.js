It was about a boy who was excited about learning to read his first words. I had no idea how to begin so I called Tom Feelings, an illustrator whose books I admired. Even though he didn't know me he showed me how he put a book together and gave me lots of helpful tips. I was really grateful, but he said, \"You don't have to thank me, just help someone else when they need it.\" I ended up learning a lesson from him that was more valuable than I realized."],["When did you start writing?","There were things I wanted to draw and I realized I couldn't wait for someone else to write a story about them so I wrote my own. Plus, a lot of things that happened when I was a kid were pretty funny and I thought they'd make great stories to illustrate.
