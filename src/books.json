You can weave in and out of rooms filled with dramatic African masks then turn a corner to find knights carrying banners, sitting astride armor-clas horses. Every visit reveals something new. \n One monday, when the museum was closed to the public, I even got to roam around the Egyptian wing on my own. That got me thinking about what it would be like to find yourself alone with all those wonderful treasures. Pretty exciting and just a bit scary, no doubt. And if you read hieroglyphs, keep an eye out for a secret message.",
